                “Roses are Red, Violets are Blue”. I think you guys should heard this phrase once in your life time.
                <br><br>
                We’re not gonna talk about Roses here. Just like this blue flower picture, it’s all about violets. Honestly, i don't even know if this picture are Violets or not. 
                <br><br>
                Have you even wonder why Violets are Blue in the first place?
